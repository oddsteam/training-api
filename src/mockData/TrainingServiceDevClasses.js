    "description": "Product Discovery is a course that blends solid product management, user experience design, and design thinking into a collaborative team-based approach to product ownership. Product ownership is one of the most critical and most difficult roles in an agile process. Too often organizations adopting agile approaches and Scrum are lead to believe a single person in a product owner role is responsible for making all the decisions about the product, down to the last detail. The result is stressed, overworked product owner that’s become a bottleneck for everyone else in the organization.\n Others with critical input and valuable skills are often shut out of the process. In the end the product being built gets worse, and people in the company are less happy than ever before. But that’s not the way agile development is supposed to work. This class is about an approach to agile product ownership that does.\n In this course we’ll teach a team-based approach to product ownership where a product owner leads a small discovery team that includes the roles and skills necessary to create a great product.",
